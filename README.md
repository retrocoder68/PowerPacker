# PowerPacker
A implementation of the PowerPacker2.0 unpack algorithm \
Copyright (C) 2020 skywalker a.k.a. J.Karlsson <j.karlsson@retrocoder.se>

I made this implementation because I wanted to learn how the original
PowerPacker algorithm made by Nico Francios work,
and maybe use it in my own Amiga projects.

I learned the algorithm by studying the source code in the ppunpack
program, copyright (c) Marc Espie, 1995, published at 
http://aminet.net/package/misc/unix/ppunpack-1.0
The original PowerPacker program copyright is owned by Nico Francois.

See pp-file-format.md for a description of how the file format is built and
how it is unpacked.
